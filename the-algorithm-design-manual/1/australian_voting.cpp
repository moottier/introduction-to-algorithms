//  Skiena Programming Challenge 1-3

/////////////
// Australian ballots require that the voter rank the candidates in order of choice. Initially only the first
// choices are counted and if one candidate receives more than 50% of the vote, that candidate is elected. If
// no candidate receives more than 50%, all candidates tied for the lowest number of votes are eliminated.
// Ballots ranking these candidates first are recounted in favour of their highest ranked candidate who
// has not been eliminated. This process continues [that is, the lowest candidate is eliminated and each
// ballot is counted in favour of its ranked non-eliminated candidate] until one candidate receives more
// than 50% of the vote or until all candidates are tied.
/////////////
// Input
//
// The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of the cases
// following, each of them as described below. This line is followed by a blank line, and there is also a
// blank line between two consecutive inputs.
// The first line of input is an integer n â‰¤ 20 indicating the number of candidates. The next n lines
// consist of the names of the candidates in order. Names may be up to 80 characters in length and may
// contain any printable characters. Up to 1000 lines follow; each contains the contents of a ballot. That
// is, each contains the numbers from 1 to n in some order. The first number indicates the candidate of
// first choice; the second number indicates candidate of second choice, and so on.
/////////////
// Output
//
// For each test case, the output must follow the description below. The outputs of two consecutive cases
// will be separated by a blank line.
// The Output consists of either a single line containing the name of the winner or several lines
// containing the names of the candidates who tied.
